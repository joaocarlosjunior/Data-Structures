#### The Computer Science course coordinator wants to know which students are the best and worst performers in the Data Structure discipline (the number of students is unknown). Your program should read a list of information, where each line will be given registration (integer) and grade (float/double). Then, every 2 students must print those with the nth best and nth worst grades.
Requirements:
  
    1 - Use only one structure (vector or linked list) to store data for all students;
  
    2 - Exclusively use row(s) and/or stack(s) and their primitive operations to manipulate (insert or display) the elements;
  
    3 - Use some method seen in the room to sort the data after all entries;
  
    4 - Provide, along with the code, justification for the choices made previously.
