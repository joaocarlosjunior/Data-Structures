#### Through a doubly linked list (of characters) write two versions of the ehPalindrome function (iterative and recursive) that determines whether the word formed by the letters in the list is a palindrome, returning true or false.
The function should work correctly in all cases, including:

  - empty list,

  - list with one node,

  - list with two nodes containing the same letters,

  - list with two nodes containing different letters,

  - list with three, four and 𝑛 nodes containing a palindrome and

  - list with three, four and 𝑛 nodes containing a non-palindrome.
